Kevin
=========
* Use `kevin -h` for a list of runtime options, e.g. running Kevin on a different port.
* To authenticate properly, your username when connecting must be your deviantART username, and the **server password** (NOT your NickServ password, it's ignored) must be your deviantART password.
* Private chats are regular channels of the form `&username`. To start a private chat with somebody, just `/join &their_username`. Remember, the other person can't see your messages unless they are also in the channel.
* Admin commands are of the form `/admin #room admin command to send`. For example, `/admin #Botdom show privclass Bots`. If you're using irssi, weechat, or a similar client, you might need to send `/quote admin #room command`.
